Let’s talk about the "skid" accusations I’ve dealt with, because honestly, it’s gotten out of hand.

## The Accusations
People love to throw around the term “skid” as if it’s a badge of superiority.

- I’ve been accused of skidding cheats like Templeware and Evo.gj—some of the most complex tools out there.
The irony? Most of these complainers act like they could code something better, yet their own skills barely scratch the surface.

## The Reality
- Here’s the thing: skidding isn’t just copy-pasting random code without a clue.

- The code I use isn’t beginner-level—it’s advanced stuff.

- I don’t blindly copy-paste; I make sure I understand what’s happening behind the scenes. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t use it in the first place.
Compare that to others out there who genuinely skid without knowing what the code even does. They’re the ones giving the term a bad rep, not me.

## Why the Complaints Are Exhausting
- Every time someone asks, "Why do you skid stuff?" (it happens more than you would think) it’s extremly annoying.

- Most of them wouldn’t know where to start with writing similar code.
- The assumption that anyone using complex resources is “lazy” is not only wrong—it’s hypocritical.
## My Take
- Using code written by others isn’t inherently bad. In fact, the whole tech world is built on collaboration and shared knowledge.

- What matters is learning from it, understanding it, and applying that knowledge to grow your own skills.
- Instead of criticizing, maybe focus on leveling up your own game, and if you think you are good find someone better to learn from as I did!

## Final Word
I’m here to create, learn, and improve. The accusations don’t bother me as much as the fact that they come from people who don’t get the process. If you’ve got something better to show, then show it. If not, let me work in peace.
